sometimes carpetmod's extra or autocrafting table are a bit behind - occasionally gnembon will have 
 a branch for the version you need, but it wont be available as an asset on github, proceed with hax

clone repo
edit gradle.properties as needed (using carpetmod's one is a great start)
./gradlew
./gradlew build
copy /build/libs/the_name_of_yer_jar.jar to this folder
...
profit?
